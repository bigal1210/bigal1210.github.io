                poem: `Writhing through
A winding mind
This stubborn snake
Has yet to find

The pieces to
Unlock his puzzle
Quite the challenge
For a measly muggle

But even though
This muggle mimes
He soon learns that gravity
Bends space and time.

What better way
To spend four years
Than performing integrals
With your peers

Or arguing about
Zhuangzi's dao
Sitting peacefully
By professor hao.

Of all the flings
I could've flung,
How could I have
chosen a better one?

                poem: `Why pick up
your crumbs
when there are ants
who'd love to help

why pull up your bed
when you're
sleeping in it
that same night.

Why pattern
your socks
when your toes
will soon be free

Why plow
the snow
when winter
is soon to slow.

Why play
when we all know
that one day
It will be time to go

Why pry
and force the day
when things will surely
turnout another way.

Why worry
of tomorrow
when the sun
is still not low,

Why worry
for tomorrow
when a new sun
is yet to crow.

To shape lives
Its hard to know
Which words
Comments
Or stories
Will affect ones charges
But sometimes
They do.

In reflection it seems,
Only the professors
I either most loved or hated 
Affected my charges.

Snarky comments
Piercing stares.
Like glasses
Between the sun, an ant, and a stone.
Belittled 
Challenged
Made to cry.

Curious catch phrases
Etched in my brain,
Like molten rivers
Through soft bed rock.
Once dancing in the dark
This kindling curiosity,
Set ablaze by wonderstruck eyes.

Both 
Helped me learn
Both
Made me grow

Stunned
By new ideas
Stupefied 
By insurmountable challenges.

Cherish
Those who drive you.
Ignore entirely
Those who do not care.`

                poem: `A poem written mostly to myself about entrepreneurship, taking risks, 
                and being comfortable in the unkown, a necessary region to enter if I want to solve problems 
                and achieve my dreams versus live within the status quo:

Into the unknown the uncharted dark.

Enter the unknown where you're yet to discover
Where you're yet to be flown 
What you're yet to uncover

Take a step toward the dark where the world is yet to build 
Where you're yet to make your mark, 
Where dreams remain unfilled.

March towards the abyss where others have not gone, 
Where your subtle kiss would bring others along.
You may find a stairway or doorway or two, 
Or have to make one yourself 
To find your next clue.

Take a step towards the unknown from where curiosity calls.
What more do you expect from the same wilting walls? 

Where it's comfy and calming is where you'll wither in vain.
Just to flame out alone, perhaps theres more to your name.

Solutions arise beyond what is known 
Why live in the shadows when there's more to be shown.

Why wait for your life if he is waiting for you 
Just on the other side of an unknown doorway or two?
