Meditation has been around for thousands of years. Nothing has changed, people are sadder and more reliant on drugs now than ever. Why would this time be any different?

Libraries have been around for thousands of years, the internet for decades, and YouTube for more than 10. Nothing has changed, people are only getting dumber, why should this time be any different?

First, we outsourced metabolic demands of movement via guns, tractors, cars, factories, elevators, etc.

Humans are inherently lazy. An ATP molecule saved is ATP molecule earned.

We soon discovered that in fact exercise is crucial for health and life, now we go to gyms where we workout for no explicit purpose.

We're in the process of entirely outsourcing metabolic demands of thinking, first via calculators, now via super duper computers, and soon via the functional equivalent of brain implants.

Will we soon realize that metabolic demands of thinking are crucial for health and longevity.

Will centers for complex integrals for no explicit purpose soon be crucial aspects of biohackers health and longevity routines?

That's why I'm studying physics. LOL 😹.">

        <div class="thought-bubble" data-thought="7" data-thought-title="Happiness" data-thought-content="People think that being happy is about doing something, thinking something, or they think that it's a thing. But really, happiness is a non - thing. It's about kinda being a retard. Just empty minded floating thru space. Like duhhhh hey, I'm here 😀. Ppl try to be happy and thats exactly what prevents the happy from coming. To be happy, you really have to try to be retarded. Just be retarded and absent minded.

This doesn't mean you should also be an idiot or un intelligent, actually being an idiot is exactly what we're trying to avoid. Idiocy is thinking really hard or thinking too hard and not getting any anywhere or any answers right. Being retarded is just being retarded. This is exactly the point of meditation, to cultivate such a profound state of focus that your brain just beams off into absent minded retardation, while also maintaining the ability to be aware present and sharp if you want to.

For Happiness, there's nothing to think about, and you think there is, that's why you're not happy. Literally just stop thinking so hard about shit and you'll be good. Think about stuff - like think about how you're gonna do this thing or that thing, but definitely don't think about how you feel, that's a recipe for un-happiness. Let yourself feel how you feel and at the same time don't think about it. Does that make sense? If you're not happy, you're probably an idiot, if you're happy, you're probably being retarded. Just duh, I'm here. Hehe. Some of the times when I've been happiest in my life were actually when I had a concussion (I've had like 6). I had no space or time to think, I was just retarded watching the trees rustling, cuz my brain was empty and legit couldn't think. There are ways to train non thinking (meditation, sports, art, other non-stressful hobbies that involve not thinking and becoming very enthralled in the thing you're doing). But if your brain is just too active that you cant stop thinking and just be retarded, try to down regulate your physiology enough so you can allow yourself to be more retarded again. There are ways to do that too, adequate nutrition and light environment, meditation, friends, reading (especially dumb books), intense exercise and sufficient rest after, healing old injuries in the body (this is a big one), but you shouldn't need any of that, happiness is mostly a thinking thing, those things just help.

Happiness by nature comes and goes. Don't force it, don't force any feelings, if a feeling arises you don't like, don't force it away. You should be retarded enough not to notice that you don't like the feeling and also retarded enough not to care about the feeling if you do. Just maintain a constant retardation in all things you do and all things you feel and you'll feel happy at some point pretty soon. Make sure not to wait for retardation, or happiness will never come. Must be retarded now.

So, overall the goal is to be retarded and happy, and also intelligent at the same time because we want to actually be aware of our happiness and also we wanna have cool interesting well articulated thoughts and do cool good things in life.

So, all that means is you need to separate the too. Be intelligent, but also be retarded in life. Be an intelligent, calm, smiling retard, but mostly an absent minded retard.">

Then you sorta just say alright, take a pic make a pose and back down the mountain we go, and make sure to stay on the trail as you do. But it never really lives up to the hype does it? Hikes are a weird pilgrimage or journey thing, a bunch of serious people wearing their maps and hiking clothes and fancy backpacks saying alright we’re going up as and this is a mission we all must do.
        On the way up you see people who are on the way down and tell you oh yeah you’re almost there just a bit more, and they say how magnificent and beautiful it all is at the top and oh its so worth it. And you smile and say okay! Then you keep walking up hill.And you build up some expectation of how it’s supposed to be, and then you get there and see a bunch of people sitting eating a sandwich.

        <div class="thought-bubble" data-thought="9" data-thought-title="Quantum Mechanics Many Worlds Interpretation" data-thought-content="In quantum mechanics, each particle, like an electron for example, holds many different possible positions at once. Meaning the particle could literally be in multiple different places until it is observed. Once the particle is observed, the wave function that describes the particle's different possible positions collapses, and the particle in question takes on one specific position in space, the one that you now see. One explanation of wave function collapse is the many worlds interpretation which describes that all possible outcomes of quantum measurement actually do occur. Meaning, each different possible position that a particle could hold actually occurs in another reality. Instead of wave function collapse and the particle taking on just one position in space, reality continually splits into parallel worlds where each quantum possibility occurs.

        The philosophical interpretation of this theory suggests that there are an infinite number of parallel universes, each with different iterations and possibilities for what could have happened (or in this case because the other universes are actually real, did happen). So, within these infinite other worlds, there are an infinite number of Alexanders, each living similar, or not-so-similar lives, with inflection points at different decisions in their lives. It's a little bit crazy to think that there is literally another universe with another me, standing typing on his computer, who equally believes that he is the real, truest, most original me, and his life is about to take an entirely different path depending on what he decides to do next. But in this specific world, where I feel I am me, and you feel you are you reading this paper, I cannot know what happens to the other equally real me's, who decided to finish this sentence differently.
        
        I just have to live, and I know that somewhere else, in another galaxy or planet or part of the space-time continuum, there is an Alexander who lived his life, so that I don't have to. And that gives me peace knowing it's okay for me to live this life.
        
        In another world, Pop is happy with Alexander because he got a nice job right after graduation. In another world, there is an Alexander who dropped out of college and already built a billion-dollar startup. But that me is not me. For me, who feels his body is his own in this cosmically independent world, I just have to live, and I know that somewhere else, in another galaxy or planet or some other part of the space-time continuum, there exists an Alexander who lived the other way that I was thinking about living. There is another Alexander who achieved all his dreams and wishes, and there's also one who did not.
        
        I just have to be this Alexander and I shouldn't try to live the best life of all the Alexanders either, because that's impossible since there will always be a better Alexander (how would you even quantify which one is the better anyway). And that's all I can do. And this is how I want to live no matter what people tell or encourage me to do. There are some Alexanders who are successful, some who die young, some who are Olympic athletes or professional soccer players, some who are high school teachers, and some who are Buddhist monks or deep-sea explorers. Hopefully none are wife beaters or murderers or corrupt politicians, hopefully there isn't a Benjamin Netanyahu version of me, but unfortunately there probably is somewhere.
        
        There are probably even fewer me's though who are okay with their lives, and don't envy the other great Alexanders. Somewhere within the infinite multiplicity of possible lives I've lived, there are at least enough Alexanders who are happy, peaceful, and present. Probably those who are, decided to live their own, and that's the thread I'd like to weave. Because those other lives are inherently inaccessible to this Alexander. There is only this one and I only have 150-200 years to live it. Luckily, I am in no rush. Memento Mori.
        “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” - Steve Jobs

        <div class="thought-bubble" data-thought="10" data-thought-title="Discipline is Bullshit" data-thought-content="I have been thinking about this topic for years. Finally, I feel like I know what my opinion is about it, or at least, I know what type of discipline I want to have.

        People think they need discipline to achieve their goals. But, discipline will only get you started in the direction you need to go, if you don't drop it, discipline and “effort” will be the exact things holding you back.
        
        Discipline is not forced exerted control. It's not an internal battle that you fight and overcome just by the grit of your teeth. Forcing yourself to do things will only result in burn out. Real, sustainable discipline, requires minimal will power. The thing that you think discipline is, is actually effortless action. It's doing what you need (want) to do without resistance, hesitation, effort, or striving. It's just doing. 
        
        So if you need discipline to eat less. You have to realize it's not about forcing yourself to eat less, it's just about neither eating nor not eating. It becomes a non thing. Some things, like eating are about not-doing. Thats where you need to be absent minded, drop things from your mind and float. Drop all the perturbations and compulsive thoughts, just be like a bee or butterfly, dumbly floating from one thing to the next. This is how you truly get rid of those bad habits, it's not by actively avoiding them or purposefully doing the “better” thing, it's by letting go of them, letting them become non-things. It's like alcohol. I have an excellent relationship with alcohol, because I don't care about it. I have a friend who used to drink a ton, and do coke and meth (this guy has a physics PHD from MIT, 4.0 gpa, worked at Goldman. He is very smart). Now, he doesn't do drugs anymore, and even though alcohol borderline ruined his life at one point, he still drinks. He just doesn't give a fuck about it anymore, he's managed to be retarded about alcohol, and just have a beer without any baggage. It's an irrelevant thing that has no bearing on his life, so he drinks when he want to because he enjoys it, and in doing so, does not over drink, because it's just another thing that is good in appropriate moderation in his life. Effortless action and absent mind - the exact opposite of discipline is going to get you the thing you want from discipline. This is what it means to be absent minded.
        
        Sometimes, discipline is about engaging in an action, this is where it's important to be lazy. Take exercise for example, I have zero discipline when it comes to exercise, but I workout probably four times a week, almost without fail. People see the way I eat and workout and sleep and they say wow, you have so much discipline. I used to be confused because I never really thought of myself as a disciplined person, but it is true, there are some things I do surprisingly well in the “disciplined sense” and there are others I totally fail at. I noticed though, its mostly the things that others think I'm “disciplined” at that require no effort on my end, and it's the things that I'm really “bad at doing consistently” that require a ton of effort on my end. I just follow what I want and desire, and I only follow that. Of course, you have to make sure your desires aren't be bad ones though. This is where some time spent reflecting on what you really want in life is helpful. I've taken the time upfront to set clearly in my mind my values, my deepest desires for my life, and my most fundamental intrinsic motivations. Taking this time upfront allows me to hone in on and stay focused on what's important to me, without getting distracted by what's superficially motivating or extrinsically rewarded in society. This is the formula, for engaging in rewarding actions without effort. Take the time upfront to set and get in touch with your desires and intrinsic motivations, and then be absent minded as you follow them.
        
        Now, when people say I'm disciplined in my health regiment, I laugh and say, I'm quite lazy, it's really the opposite. I tap into my desires and I focus on how I feel in the moment. Sure, it takes some discipline to get started on the path of eating healthy, but once you start, and you feel good, all you need to do is pay attention to how you feel and that will keep you going. Tap into your deep desire, remind yourself of that desire, and then take action without effort, and if your motivation falters, just remind yourself of what you really desire. The only reason I try to get to bed early every night is because I feel so good on a full nights sleep and so bad not sleeping. It's got nothing to do with discipline, it's really more lazy and even a bit pathetic. This, by the way, is also how to have an extremely healthy lifestyle without being compulsive about it. It's a delicate and effortless balance. 
        
        Let's say you think you should workout. Before you decide to start, take time to think about and outline why you want to workout. What are your deepest intrinsic motivations behind achieving the goal associated with working out. Wanting to be “in shape”, or wanting to “not be fat” probably aren't deep enough, and if they are your immediate answer, keep asking yourself why, until you arrive at a core/foundational motivation that is driving your action. In doing this, you may realize that actually the thing you wanted has nothing to do with exercise, in which case, you may not need to exercise. Instead, do the other thing that will help you arrive at what you truly want. 
        
        Figure out what your deepest desires and intrinsic motivations, make them clear in your mind, establish why you want them and make sure you understand that you really do, and then go after them. If your “motivation” falters, remind yourself what you want, and you'll be right back on the effortless action bandwagon. 
        
        Me not eating junk food requires no discipline, because I eat cookies and ice cream all the time. I just make sure to only choose high quality cookies and ice cream with good quality ingredients. At the same time, I also know what feels good. I try to pay enough attention and be aware enough to recognize when certain things feel good and others feel bad. So, I indulge, and I really feel like I can have it all, without sacrifice. This is what I try to do to achieve my goals and get off of the discipline hamster wheel. I pay attention to what feels good, what feels bad, and what I truly desire, and figure out how I can have it all. For the most part - there's no need to sacrifice and no need to strive, effortless action is the way. 
        
        This entire perspective is not about avoiding what you want, or forcing yourself to do things you think you should do. It's about not making assumptions, about questioning your desires, fully indulging in what you truly want, and then following that. If you do that, you will need a lot less forced disciplined to accomplish your goals. You can just sit back and listen to yourself. Trust yourself. And follow yourself.
        
        
        Frameworks I use to think about discipline. 
        
        1. Intrinsic motivation
        2. Deep Desires
        3. Using mindfulness to guide and rewire behaviors. (Read the mindfulness antidote to discipline for more on this) 
            1. Note: Identifying your intrinsic motivation and deep desires makes it much easier to rewire your behavior.
        4. Absent Mindedness/Effortless Action
        
        When you feel like you can do the thing you want while:
        1. Eliminating striving and effort.
        2. Have it all without sacrifice
        
        You'll get the benefits of hardcore discipline without wearing yourself out.
        
        The combination of all these leads to success through effortless action. ">

Bitcoin is by far (and still is) the best (and coolest) place to put your money. 

It's a deflationary speculative asset designed to be a store of value. Um, hello? That means that right now it's appreciating like a high beta tech stock, while retaining its value like gold as it converges toward becoming a mature store of value. Bitcoin isn't a company that can go bankrupt like those in the dot-com bubble, it's a decentralized monetary network that won't just 'disappear' like a business or stock.

It does not get much better than that. You don't get many opportunities to get in on a store value while it's still in its speculative growth phase. That's a dream come true.

There's a mismatch here and the mismatch wont last forever.

Now for the moral side.

Imagine being able to own an un-hackable un-steal-able non counterfeit-able near instantly transferable asset that is totally 100% yours without dependence on anyone, anything, any system, or any other institution to maintain or send it for you.

It's not an investment, it's literally digital property that anybody can own and exchange no matter their race ethnicity creed skin color gender beliefs age religion or dogma. And no one can take it from you either, no matter how hard they try.

UNREAL. If that's not the ultimate fuck you to the system, I don't know what is. Owning Bitcoin means something. That right there, is like the world united.

Get some while there's still more to be mined. 

Keep in mind, I'm nowhere near early with this (tho it is still early) or totally original in my thinking, but I do really believe what I wrote and cut me some slack, I only became conscious a few years ago.">

        The mindfulness antidote to discipline explained through food and over eating:

        With over eating, it's not about resisting more food - that will always fail. It's about paying attention to other things. Focusing on how you feel doing other things you enjoy, and how good you feel when you eat less. 
        
        If you're practice being mindful in a way that helps you notice when a behavior isn't rewarding anymore, the brain will disengage from the behavior on its own. All that's necessary is observing without judgment. Notice how it feels after you do something, especially something that you want to stop doing. You don't even need to do anything after, not much self talk is necessary, it's mostly just observation, feeling that feeling, not what you think about how you feel, just how you feel. Don't try to control the feeling or tell yourself a story about the feeling, just observe your body, your feelings, and what they do. If you give the brain the space to observe the negative feeling it will recognize that it actually doesn't like doing that thing, which will weaken the reward pathway associated with that thing. If you engage in an action you don't like and immediately beat yourself up after for doing it, your brain won't have the space to recognize how you actually feel and it will only create a negative loop of self loathing and disappointment that makes it harder to get over the bad habit. Giving it the space to feel whatever you feel after, is what will allow the brain to create new reward pathways, pushing you away from some things, and towards others. 
        
        In mindfulness based cognitive therapy, or behavioral neuroscience, this is called reward based learning. Overtime, your brain sees that the behavior isn't as rewarding as it thought, which lets it rewire the loop, allowing you to replace bad habits with actions that you think are healthier or that you'd prefer to engage in instead. When you do this though, make sure you start without preconceptions about what you “think” is good or bad. Your body will generally not lead you astray as long as you don't cloud it with thinking. If a behavior that you “think” is bad, feels good and continues to feel good in the aftermath, then maybe you don't need to make a change. Again, see how this has nothing to do with forced or exerted control. 
        
        Hating yourself for making mistakes or forcing yourself to do something your brain hasn't realized that you really want or that you yourself haven't taken the time to appropriately establish why you want, will lead to a fear based mindset around habits and discipline. Using this mindfulness strategy can help you gently rewire yourself so that actions are more sustainable easy, natural, and not hard.
        
        Warning: using this strategy might make you really bad at things like school because you'll realize that in general (depending on your school and professor) school doesn't do a great job encouraging learning for inner intrinsic purposes, or give students opportunity to develop genuine curiosity about the subject through things like guided inquiry and exploration.">

        Talking With Paul, Meaning of Life: 


Alex: 
What's the meaning of life?

Paul: 
Meaning is very vague in this context. Meaning of a word vs. meaning of life. Significance maybe is a better word. So then you say what's important to you? 

- Family, work, living life to the full, taking care of my body. 
- Religious practice is not important to me.

Alex:
Where does the world come from?

Paul:
- Important not to mix up science and religion.
- Chain of events where if you keep asking why you arrive at just because. (Interjection from Alex: Watch the Feynman video about asking why) 
- So then u ask why something rather than nothing but of course that's an impossible question because it presupposes something.
- Origin of the universe is the job of physicists, there will always be some puzzling beginning most likely. Maybe it goes on forever. 
- Maybe comforting to have an answer to this question, some feel it comforting to say god. 
- Of course you could always ask what about god.
- And religious people think you're being unpleasant but you know they dont have an answer, and well i dont know haha.

Alex: 
So what do you do about this mystery?

Paul:
- I don't do anything.
- Philosophy is full of paradoxes and they play an important role because you feel a certain tension and you're so strongly inclined to make certain assumptions. 
- Often the reaction to a puzzle is that you're making some kind of mistake, and even articulating it and thinking there was a problem. 
- Real solution is often to look again and realize either:
        - An assumption you were making is actually not that obvious
        - Or you say it's not so clear that this comes from that
        - Or the conclusion that you thought was impossible to accept, if you look at it in the right way you can accept.

'Tell me', Wittgenstein once asked a friend, 'why do people always say, it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating?'

 His friend replied, 'Well, obviously because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.' 

Wittgenstein replied, 'Well, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?' 

What would it have looked like if we looked at all sciences from the viewpoint of Wittgenstein's philosophy?">
