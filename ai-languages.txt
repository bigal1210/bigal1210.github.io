AI is already insanely good at speaking other languages. And it doesn’t just speak one or two languages, it speaks literally all of them, in all of their possible dialects. Earlier this month I was talking to chat GPT, and randomly decided to ask it: فيك تحكي معي بالعربي اللبناني؟” (“Can you talk to me in Lebanese Arabic”). To my surprise, GPT responded immediately in perfect Lebanese Arabic. Next, I told it, okay, talk to me like a local. Right away, GPT code switched into a Lebanese “Aamiyah”( عاميه), which is Arabic for the local/street tongue. I was blown away. Within consecutive sentences, GPT could switch between English, Arabic, Lebanese Arabic, French, Chinese, and even speak solid Jamaican Patois. Pretty freakin’ impressive.

Earlier this summer, I traveled to Taiwan, China and Hong Kong for about a month. I was both terrified and embarrassed to say anything in Chinese. On the first day, I could barely muster the courage to say “xiexie, 谢谢” to the man who helped me buy my first bus pass at a 7-11. 

Quickly though, I discovered the translating superpowers of chat GPT (which works on super low cell service by the way), and by the end of the month I was flirting with Taiwanese hairdressers in Chinese saying how I knew deep down she wishes she could travel back in time and run away with me to Bangkok.

I used chat GPT everywhere I went, and it helped a ton. I learned new words, took pictures of things I couldn’t read, but most importantly, GPT gave me the courage to start conversations with people (in Chinese) that I otherwise would’ve shied away from. Traveling around China/Taiwan/HK on my own, I realized two things. Firstly, where ten years ago people would’ve likely needed translators to help them travel, today it’s entirely unnecessary. GPT is so fast and translates so naturally, that you can have a fluid conversation even if neither party speaks the same language. 


Traveling with GPT in my pocket, it really hit me that speaking languages is not technically useful anymore. While coding, and other sciences will continue to be conducted in English, with the help of LLM’s and AR/mixed reality, I struggle to see a world where people speak anything other than their own local languages. When I arrived in Taiwan, I was shocked at how few people spoke English. Pretty quickly though, I realized that since they only communicate with each other 99% of the time, and foreigners can use GPT, there is actually no reason to learn English. 

I was likewise shocked by how few expats living in HongKong spoke Chinese. Even many kids who grew up in HK their whole lives didn’t speak a word of Chinese - not an exaggeration. My experience leads me to believe that even English will soon only be spoken in the US, UK, Canada etc. To clarify, what I’m is that as time goes on, fewer people will speak English as a second language.

When you think about it though, this isn’t really a new phenomenon. Other than a select few people, I don’t think there ever was a time in history when speaking other languages was technically useful. 500 years ago, there was mostly no use in speaking anything other than your own village’s dialect. Even 100 years ago, other than a few select professions, people really only interacted with those in their immediate communities. For a brief moment in history, globalization made speaking multiple languages feel necessary, but now I think AI might be reversing that trend—bringing us back to a world where people only speak their native tongues. First with google translate and now more blatantly with AI, speaking languages probably just doesn’t matter anymore. 

And so, despite all this, I believe now is the best time in the history of the world to learn new languages. Here’s why: 

Language was never meant to be a means for transmitting information, instead it’s a window into the world of authenticity, self-expression, and creativity. much in the same way I imagine it feels to create or perform music, speaking languages makes me feel alive in unique ways. As AI gets really good at producing great entertainment, I think people will value quality less and instead gravitate toward being a part of experiences they can emotionally connect with. Take music for example, because I have a deeper emotional connection with my Aunt’s work I’d much rather listen to her music than some random pop artist. I can directly experience her creating music and even affect her songs as she writes them. Even if a pop star’s music is “technically” superior quality, I’d rather experience and listen to hers. 

Arabic music follows an entirely different tonal system and beat structure from western music, likewise, speaking other languages opens up new avenues of self-expression. What I’m trying to say is that like music, speaking languages unlocks new ways of expressing your thoughts and world views. It’s hard to articulate, but speaking French allows me to express a different part of who I am that I feel English does not let me access. It’s like walking around in a new outfit or clothes that you designed yourself, driving a stick shift car, or painting with a newly discovered color. Speaking Arabic on the streets of Beirut gives me a ticket to a rich cultural experience otherwise inaccessible to non-Arabic speakers. I’m telling you right now, flirting in French is not the same. 

Language shapes how we think, feel, and connect. Even if AI can translate perfectly, it can’t replace the feeling of thinking and living in another language.

Speaking languages, to me, is not about communicating information, but instead about drawing with the entire box of crayons, each language another color. I beleive that language’s primary purpose was never to transmit information but instead to enable emotional connection through creative storytelling. 

If AI is going to take over the “practical” side of speaking, all it does is free us to further explore our own creativity, culture, raw human expression, and potential for creation. If you want to connect with others, share stories, have creative conversations, become immersed in culture, expand your imagination, and discover new way to express yourself, I recommend speaking differently. Languages absolutely suck ass to learn, but I think even just a basic speaking level proficiency is #worth. 

Overall thanks AI, but also AI is scary. I hope we don’t die. Hopefully Elon Musk’s existential imperative to save the world is both real and well informed, hopefully Sam Altman isn’t evil, and hopefully the Chinese dictators don’t take over the world.

Note. None of this was written with AI.
