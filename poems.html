A winding mind
This stubborn snake
Has yet to find

The pieces to
Unlock his puzzle
Quite the challenge
For a measly muggle

But even though
This muggle mimes
He soon learns that gravity
Bends space and time.

What better way
To spend four years
Than performing integrals
With your peers

Or arguing about
Zhuangzi's dao
Sitting peacefully
By professor hao.

Of all the flings
I could've flung,
How could I have
chosen a better one?

Why pattern
your socks
when your toes
will soon be free

Why plow
the snow
when winter
is soon to slow.

Why play
when we all know
that one day
It will be time to go

Why pry
and force the day
when things will surely
turnout another way.

Why worry
of tomorrow
when the sun
is still not low,

Why worry
for tomorrow
when a new sun
is yet to crow.

To shape lives
Its hard to know
Which words
Comments
Or stories
Will affect ones charges
But sometimes
They do.

In reflection it seems,
Only the professors
I either most loved or hated 
Affected my charges.

Snarky comments
Piercing stares.
Like glasses
Between the sun, an ant, and a stone.
Belittled 
Challenged
Made to cry.

Curious catch phrases
Etched in my brain,
Like molten rivers
Through soft bed rock.
Once dancing in the dark
This kindling curiosity,
Set ablaze by wonderstruck eyes.

Both 
Helped me learn
Both
Made me grow

Stunned
By new ideas
Stupefied 
By insurmountable challenges.

Cherish
Those who drive you.
Ignore entirely
Those who do not care.`

                Into the unknown the uncharted dark.

Enter the unknown where you're yet to discover
Where you're yet to be flown 
What you're yet to uncover

Take a step toward the dark where the world is yet to build 
Where you're yet to make your mark, 
Where dreams remain unfilled.

March towards the abyss where others have not gone, 
Where your subtle kiss would bring others along.
You may find a stairway or doorway or two, 
Or have to make one yourself 
To find your next clue.

Take a step towards the unknown from where curiosity calls.
What more do you expect from the same wilting walls? 

Where it's comfy and calming is where you'll wither in vain.
Just to flame out alone, perhaps theres more to your name.

Solutions arise beyond what is known 
Why live in the shadows when ther'es more to be shown.

Why wait for your life if he is waiting for you 
Just on the other side of an unknown doorway or two?

            Who did that boy wish to be?
            From his eyes again, take a moment to stop and see.

            The world from his point of view
            And remind yourself, what that boy wished to do.
            What do you think he would likely say 
            about the man that you're gearing up to be one day.

            I watched you as you formed your mold.
            Did you have a dream, for how you wanted your character to unfold?

            Remember him as you take your steps,
            And take them softly, no need to stress.

            Ask yourself again today:
            Who do you want to be for this world?

            You can choose it's up to you,
            How you'll act, how you'll be, 
            Remember him when you choose what you'll do.

            I'll watch you while you shut your eyes,
            And be with you as you take your final sigh.

            How do you think you'll be remembered here,
            What dreams do you hope to have on your closing day upon this sphere?

                            poem: `You're tuned to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here awhile

Now that all future plans have been postponed
And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?

And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?

If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust.

When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls
We're all bathed in its grace.

Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on

And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light.

Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
You don't reach for bliss.

God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo.

In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you

                            it will turn out.
This is it.
No one else has the answer,
no other place will be better,
and it has already turned out.

At the centre of your being,
you have the answer:
you know who you are and 
you know what you want.

There is no need to run outside
for better seeing,
nor to peer from a window.
Rather abide at the centre of your being:
for the more you leave it,
the less you learn.

Search your heart and see
the way to do is to be.
